We feel mankind’s inhumanity brought to life for us through the voice of the boy soldier. The writing is easy to read and beautiful. The content is powerful, gripping, horrific, violent and explicit. This novel is illuminating; as innocence is stripped away what kind of creature do we become?",
        "extract":"White dust wraps around him as the pebbles dig and dig. The back of his head opens, and it's red for less than a moment before the pieces are painted grey. Each little stone takes a piece of him with it, less and less and less. Landmines don't kill you, they eat you.All this in an instant. Boom! The cloud and pebbles are huge and high, taking up all the air in front of me. Out of the cloud flies a grey dust-painted half-person. One leg and his stomach fly off the road. His left arm sails over my head. The wind from the mine kicks me backwards and I land on another boy",

It's written in such a way you feel you're snooping into the lives of others which I find a bit uncomfortable. But a very interesting concept with an intriguing ending – so hang on in there.",
        "extract":"Some people don't care if you're special. They will punish you anyway. Neighbours, for example, will report a girl, even a smart girl, with a girlfriend. The police will hurt you, if they get the chance. One person up the Okhotsk coast has been burned to death for this only a couple of years earlier. Masha moved away from home at seventeen; when she thought back on life in Kamchatka, she probably pictured volcanoes, tasted caviar, remembered hikes on stone paths to the clouds. She didn't understand what happened these days to girls as innocent as she and Lada had been. They were destroyed for it. Any girl would be. The Golosovsky sisters, who, walking alone, made themselves vulnerable - that one mistake cost them their lives.",

The revealing of once hidden truths makes the navigation towards acceptance and forgiveness a shocking and dangerous journey.",

I've spent the past few weeks hoping and wishing I could go back in time, fix everything that went wrong, but now I find myself wishing it had never happened.",

You will need a strong stomach to cope with all the blood-letting, as here the villains are nastier, the killings grislier - and with no moral certainties any more, whose side will you be on?",
        "extract":"A minute passed and then another. The smoke alarm sounded, the smell of something burning. Nora heard footsteps go past. Something hit the floor hard outside her door, shaking the wooden boards. She heard a man's voice call out, and then nothing else. Nora didn't dare to move. There was no sound now, just Nora sitting in a pitch-black room with only the sliver of light entering from beneath the door. She waited. Something dark and liquid began to creep beneath her door. She knew already what it was, the light slowly disappearing as the blood spread out along the floorboards.",

Reading it I felt as though I was watching the story unfold through one-way glass in the room next door.",
        "extract":"Had he already known when he woke up that the reason for the trip wasn't only to avoid the police's interrogation? The questioning at the station had scared him less the day after. When he had left the station, his hands trembled on the car's steering wheel, but since he had started carrying out the plan, the shaking had ceased. He was frightened not because of the questions the detective had posed to him but rather because of those he had not. And he had no reason to panic. At night he'd spoken with Chava Cohen and the conversation had gone well. The investigation had certainly turned away from him, or would do so in the days to come. He could have cancelled the trip - and in retrospect, if he had cancelled it, it was possible he wouldn't have been caught - but he already wanted to get away for other reasons.",

Doctor Svenson seemed to her less formidable and more stricken by common fears and hesitancies, but then so was she - and Miss Temple knew that no one in her world would have granted her the capacity to survive what she already had.

I loved the brooding atmosphere in the book, as much as the voice of Sunday who is brutally honest telling the story.",
          "extract":"I was engulfed by her. I was held up weightlessly within her gaze, exactly as I had once floated in the cold, dark lake with my sister. It was a sensation like safety. But Vita was still talking: to come with me? I suppose you're, urn, working?' Vita said 'working' as if it was a foreign and unfamiliar word that required concentration for correct pronunciation.'Yes. But I would rather work than go shopping with you.'Her gaze was still fixed on me, but she remained silent for a time, and I noticed the break in her pattern of speech. So far, she had only taken brief pauses in her speech when she specifically wanted a response, and her words were like early fireworks: -tuh -tuh -tuh -tuh -tuh -tuh -tuh -silence tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh silence. I wondered if anyone had ever refused this charming woman anything before. Then she smiled and clapped her hands together like a starlet in a silent film.'Oh, I fucking love that. I love honest people, darling. It's so much easier to say what you think, isn't it? I bet there isn't much of that here, though, is there? Everyone in these little towns is so polite. Inside their little houses. So concerned with what other people think.'",

Granny Doyle is so much in thrall to the Pontiff and filled with religious fervour, that she decides her next grandchild is destined to become the first Irish Pope. The comic brio of the Irish vernacular, with nods to the 'Father Ted' series, belies the tragic elements of this riotous family saga, so you can be sure of plenty of great 'craic' too!",
          "extract":"Granny Doyle squinted at the video in front of her. 'Ah, you didn't need to be bothering with this nonsense! ... Would you look at the cut of them!' Granny Doyle said, examining the box. 'Yer man Flatley prancing about in leather pants and that one beside him, flailing her arms about like she's drowning! It's a great gladness that Mammy didn't have to see this like!'... John Paul loved the craic and the chat of the porch: the jokes with Mrs Nugent and the challenge of making Mrs McGinty smile and the treat of seeing Granny Doyle happy ... The porch brought insulation, chat that could swaddle her, while she sat quiet enough in the middle, content to pass the day discussing the gall of Fiona Brennan (parading about in poms, as if she invented Irish dancing!) and the cheek of a Divorce Referendum (it couldn't pass!) and the general goodness of John Paul (a great lad, isn't he? John Paul was a great lad, at least in the porch, where he liked to see himself reflected in the eyes of the old ladies, a boy bringing presents to his grandmother, the kind of figure who might one day summon the future through smiles and dry ice, the breaths of audiences stolen clean from their bodies at the sight of such brilliance: a hero.",

This whimsical tale is a cheerful tonic for those cold wintry days, when Spring still seems a long way off.",

Wouldn’t Trivial Pursuit be better?'With my hands in casts Trivial Pursuit isn’t very practical.'I could tell my mum was wondering if it was really my dad sitting across from her.'Yes, Dad’s right, I’d rather play Monopoly. All three of us.I put on my whiny little voice, the one from back when I used to try and charm my mum in order to get my way. Dad gestured towards me with his casts as if I were the bearer of some universal truth. My mum sat down. She’d surrendered. But she still had to have the last word.'All right, but not for long!'",

She is, as was I, fond of her easy life as a bookish person, with her friends and her pub-quiz team. Until a long lost dead father turns her life around, gives her siblings and a boyfriend she doesn't want. What more can I want as a reader, lusting for something funny, light and airy as a chocolate cupcake with a bit of chili?",

'I thought I was asking about her vacation, but it turned out she'd stayed home and gone further than she ever thought possible.' She tipped her head down to peer at Nina over her glasses, her short, dark hair barely touched with gray, despite the several careers she'd had, and the many cities and lives she'd been part of. 'There was a long portion about the deep inner beauty of yogurt when viewed through the lens of hallucinogens that put me off Yoplait for life.'Nina regarded her carefully. 'I find that story almost impossible to believe.'Liz turned and walked toward non-fiction. 'I should hope so, seeing as I completely made it up.'",

The questioning at the station had scared him less the day after. When he had left the station, his hands trembled on the car's steering wheel, but since he had started carrying out the plan, the shaking had ceased. He was frightened not because of the questions the detective had posed to him but rather because of those he had not. And he had no reason to panic. At night he'd spoken with Chava Cohen and the conversation had gone well. The investigation had certainly turned away from him, or would do so in the days to come. He could have cancelled the trip - and in retrospect, if he had cancelled it, it was possible he wouldn't have been caught - but he already wanted to get away for other reasons.",
